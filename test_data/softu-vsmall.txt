At the close of World War II, the Zionist movement gained enough support for the creation of a Jewish homeland. By 1948, the Mandate for Palestine, by which the British had administered the region, was terminated by the United Nations (UN) Resolution 181. As a result, the Jewish inhabitants of the region declared their independence and the statehood of Israel. Arab nations rejected the state of Israel while western powers acknowledged the new country. After the British left the newly formed state, several Arab nations, including Egypt, Syria, Iraq, Lebanon, Jordan, and Saudi Arabia, declared war on Israel. Invasions by Egyptian, Syrian and Jordanian forces began the Israeli War of Independence. The armistice for this war, signed in 1949, partitioned additional land to Israel than originally agreed to by the United Nations resolution. By 1967, the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union was in full force. Many Arab countries enjoyed military and financial support from the Soviet Union, while the U.S., Britain, and France continued to support Israel. The 6-day war occurred in June of 1967 as a response to the actions of Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser who closed the straits of Tiran to Israeli shipping and expelled UN peacekeepers. In response, Israel launched attacks on the Egyptian air force and began an occupation of Sinai and Gaza, as well as the West Bank and Golan Heights. Tentative peace was established through UN Resolution 242. However, many Arabs, including those within the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO), rejected the terms of the resolution. As a result, on October 6, 1973, Egyptian and Syrian forces launched an attack on Israel during the Jewish holy day of atonement. Both the U.S. and the Soviet Union aided in supplying their respective allies with arms. In an effort to respond to the U.S. and western powers' support of Israel during this war, the oil-producing nations under the cartel of OPEC reduced their production of oil and halted their commerce with those nationsâ€”thus resulting in the Arab oil embargo of 1973.

During the 1960s, this country had a surplus capacity of crude oil which we were able to make available to our trading partners whenever there was a disruption of supply. This surplus capacity enabled us to influence both supplies and prices of crude oil throughout the world. Our excess capacity neutralized any effort at establishing an effective cartel, and thus the rest of the world was assured of adequate supplies of oil at reasonable prices.

By 1970, our surplus capacity had vanished, and as a consequence, the latent power of the oil cartel could emerge in full force. Europe and Japan, both heavily dependent on imported oil, now struggle to keep their economies in balance. Even the United States, our country, which is far more self-sufficient than most other industrial countries, has been put under serious pressure.
